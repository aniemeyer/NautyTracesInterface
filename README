Installation
------------

Currently, an appropriate version of nauty
is provided in this repository. The following
installation guide is for the checked in version of nauty.

First, configure nauty

Then edit `makefile` to have the variable `CFLAGS` contain `-fPIC`.
(TODO: Provide appropriate patch for configure.)
